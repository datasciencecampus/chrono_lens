This is the public repository of the Traffic Cameras analysis project as
published on the ONS DSC [Blog](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/projects/estimating-vehicle-and-pedestrian-activity-from-town-and-city-traffic-cameras/) as part of the ONS
Coronavirus Faster Indicators (for example - [Traffic Camera Activity - 10th September 2020](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronavirustheukeconomyandsocietyfasterindicators/10september2020#traffic-camera-activity)) and
the underlying [methodology](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/methodologies/usingtrafficcameraimagestoderiveanindicatorofbusynessexperimentalresearch).
The project utilised Google Compute Platform to enable a scalable solution, but
the underlying methodology is platform agnostic; this repository contains the
core methodology, where an additional repository will be created for the GCP
wrapping.

We are currently finishing a review of the code ready for public release and aim to release
source code in September 2020.
